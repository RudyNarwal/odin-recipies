            <p>Ingredients:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Guanciale:</strong> This is a key ingredient in carbonara, and is a cured fatty pork that is similar to bacon and pancetta.<br> It adds adds flavour into the dish and the fat makes the sauce creamy when mixed with the egg and starchy pasta cooking water.</li>
                <li><strong>Parmigiano reggiano:</strong> This is basically a premium parmesan that’s been aged so it has more complex flavours.<br> It adds salt into the sauce as well as thickening it. <b>Pecorino romano</b>, which is made from sheep milk, is also commonly used, or a combination of the two.<br> Substitute with parmesan cheese. </li>
                <li><strong>Egg yolks and whole eggs:</strong> The egg combined with the guanciale fat is what makes the stunning creamy carbonara sauce that the world is obsessed with.<br> There’s no need for cream for a creamy sauce! See section above for why.</li>
                <li><strong>Spaghetti:</strong> While you can use any long pasta, the most common type used is spaghetti.</li>
                <li><strong>Pepper:</strong> For seasoning. Freshly ground black pepper recommended here.</li>
                <li><strong>Garlic, optional:</strong>While not strictly traditional, garlic is a popular addition and it does add extra flavour into it. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Steps:</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Batons</strong> Cut the guanciale into thick batons. Biting through the golden brown crust into meaty bits of salty guanciale is part of the awesomeness that is carbonara! </li>
                    <li><strong>Finely grate</strong> the parmigiana reggiano or pecorino. I use a microplane – one of can’t-live-without kitchenware items!</li>
                    <li><strong>Sauce</strong> Whisk together the egg, cheese and pepper in a large bowl. It needs to be a large bowl because the pasta will be stirred into the sauce in the bowl, off the stove, to avoid scrambling the eggs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cook pasta</strong> Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with 1 tablespoon of salt. <br>Cook the pasta per packet directions. It should be firm, not soft, but fully cooked through.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reserve pasta cooking water</strong> Just before draining, scoop out one cup of pasta cooking water. Then drain the pasta in a colander.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cook guanciale</strong> until golden while the pasta is cooking. You don’t need any oil, the guanciale will fry in its own fat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Toss pasta in guanciale</strong> Tumble the hot pasta into the pan with the guanciale then toss so the pasta gets coated in the guanciale fat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transfer into sauce bowl</strong> Tip the hot pasta into the bowl with the egg and use a rubber spatula to scrape out every drop of the guanciale fat into the bowl. That stuff is gold!</li>
                    <li><strong>Add 1/2 cup pasta cooking water</strong> into the bowl.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mix vigorously</strong> with the handle of a wooden spoon, spinning the pasta around, for around 30 seconds to 1 minute. <b>Watch</b> as the watery pale yellow liquid magically transforms into a creamy sauce.</li>
                </ol>
