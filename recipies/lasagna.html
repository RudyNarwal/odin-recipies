            <p>Ingredients:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cheese filling:</strong> For theis classic lasagna recipe, the cheese filling has ricotta and <br>parmesan with seasoning. You can make homemade ricotta cheese <br> or replace it with cottage cheese.</li>
                <li><strong>Meat:</strong> I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add <br>1/4 teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the mixture for flavor<br> or make homemade.</li>
                <li><strong>Sausage:</strong> To keep this sauce quick I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce.</li>
            </ul>
