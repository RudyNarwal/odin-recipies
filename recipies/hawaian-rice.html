            <p>Ingredients:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ham:</strong> Sometimes, to save on time, I buy the ham at the store that is already cubed and ready to go!</li>
                <li><strong>White Onion:</strong> Make sure that you are cutting up your vegetables to be similar in size so that they all cook at the same rate.</li>
                <li><strong>Red Bell Pepper:</strong> Seed and chop this up to mix into the rice.</li>
                <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> I like to use large eggs whenever I am cooking in the kitchen</li>
                <li><strong>Rice:</strong> Cook your rice beforehand. Actually, day-old rice mixes in the best for this recipe! I like to use jasmine rice.</li>
                <li><strong>Pineapple:</strong> You can use fresh pineapple, or you can use a can of them to make things easier.</li>
                <li><strong>Sesame oil:</strong> This adds THE best flavor to the rice.</li>
                <li><strong>Green Onions:</strong> These are an optional garnish that I like to put on top, but I wouldnâ€™t skip them! They add in a lot of color and flavor.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Steps:</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Cook veggies</strong> Preheat a large skillet or wok to medium heat. <br>Pour vegetable oil in the bottom. Add chopped ham, white onion, and red bell pepper and fry until tender.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cook the Eggs</strong> Slide the ham, onion, and red bell pepper to the side, <br>and pour the beaten eggs onto the other side. Using a spatula, scramble the eggs. Once cooked, mix the eggs with the vegetable mix.</li>
                    <li><strong>Combine cheese mixture</strong> Add the rice and pineapple to the veggie, ham and egg mixture.<br> Pour the soy sauce and sesame oil on top. Stir and fry the rice mixture and veggie mixture until heated through and combined. Add chopped green onions if desired</li>
